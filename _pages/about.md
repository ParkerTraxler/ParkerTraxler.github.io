Iâ€™m a developer and student with an interest in full-stack development. I'm currently diving deeper into backend development using **Flask**, **Node.js**, and **MySQL**, while also gaining proficiency in **Linux system administration** and **cloud platforms** like **Azure**.

My technical toolbox spans across multiple domains:
- **Web Development**: Node.js, Express, Flask
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C/C++
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Azure
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB

Iâ€™m especially interested in building robust systems that are secure, scalable, and maintainable. My recent work involves refactoring backend architectures, designing general-purpose request models, and developing dashboards with multi-level approval workflows.

I believe in learning by doing. Iâ€™ve completed several projects that integrate **authentication systems**, **role-based access control**, and **organizational reporting**â€”and I'm always eager to take on new technical challenges that push me further.
